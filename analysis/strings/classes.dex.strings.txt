7EmojiCompat font provider not available on this device.
EmojiCompat is not initialized.
You must initialize EmojiCompat prior to referencing the EmojiCompat instance.
The most likely cause of this error is disabling the EmojiCompatInitializer
either explicitly in AndroidManifest.xml, or by including
androidx.emoji2:emoji2-bundled.
Automatic initialization is typically performed by EmojiCompatInitializer. If
you are not expecting to initialize EmojiCompat manually in your application,
please check to ensure it has not been removed from your APK's manifest. You can
do this in Android Studio using Build > Analyze APK.
In the APK Analyzer, ensure that the startup entry for
EmojiCompatInitializer and InitializationProvider is present in
 AndroidManifest.xml. If it is missing or contains tools:node="remove", and you
intend to use automatic configuration, verify:
  1. Your application does not include emoji2-bundled
  2. All modules do not contain an exclusion manifest rule for
     EmojiCompatInitializer or InitializationProvider. For more information
     about manifest exclusions see the documentation for the androidx startup
     library.
If you intend to use emoji2-bundled, please call EmojiCompat.init. You can
learn more in the documentation for BundledEmojiCompatConfig.
If you intended to perform manual configuration, it is recommended that you call
EmojiCompat.init immediately on application startup.
If you still cannot resolve this issue, please open a bug with your specific
configuration to help improve error message.
